    becoming a local copy of the project. I make a branch off from the copy that I can make my own edits without affecting the code from the copy, and once I save my alterations
    I'll send it to my local copy to officially submit my changes to the code and I'm gonna push the copy from my computer and back into the cloud where I then submit a pull request to get
    my alterations checked, approved, and merge into the main branch of the project.
